# Explainable-Stock-Recommender
Stock Market Recommender with Strategic Move Explanation
Overview
This project is a stock market recommender system inspired by chess game engines, where every move (stock selection) is explained with pros and cons. The goal is to assist users in making informed investment decisions by providing detailed justifications and data-driven analysis behind each recommendation.

Rather than simply showing buy/sell signals, the system presents stock options like a strategy game, where users are guided through each potential move with comprehensive reasoning, enabling smarter portfolio building.

## Features
